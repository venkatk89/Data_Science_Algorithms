## Data

The `atmos` data set resides in the `nasaweather` package of the *R* programming language. It contains a collection of atmospheric variables measured between 1995 and 2000 on a grid of 576 coordinates in the western hemisphere. The data set comes from the [2006 ASA Data Expo](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2006/).

Some of the variables in the `atmos` data set are:

* **cloudlow** - The mean percent of the sky covered by clouds at low altitudes.

* **cloudmid** - The mean percent of the sky covered by clouds at mid-range altitudes.

* **cloudhigh** - The mean percent of the sky covered by clouds at high altitudes.

You can convert the temperature unit from Kelvin to Celsius with the formula

$$ celsius = kelvin - 273.15 $$

And you can convert the result to Fahrenheit with the formula

$$ fahrenheit = celsius \times \frac{9}{5} + 32 $$

## Cleaning

```{r echo = FALSE}
year <- 2000
```

For the remainder of the report, we will look only at data from the year `r year`. We aggregate our data by location, using the *R* code below.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(nasaweather)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
means <- atmos %>%
  filter(year == year) %>%
  group_by(long, lat) %>%
  summarize(temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE),
         pressure = mean(pressure, na.rm = TRUE),
         ozone = mean(ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudlow = mean(cloudlow, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudmid = mean(cloudmid, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudhigh = mean(cloudhigh, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

clouds <- means %>%
  select(-(temp:ozone)) %>%
  gather("altitude", "coverage", 3:5)
```
