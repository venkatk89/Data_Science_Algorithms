This folder contains different ways in which categorical variables can be used in data modelling techniques. <br>

Common ML/DL algorithms can be employed to deal with categorical variables. In this repository, the following models were built to predict the dependent variables where all the independent variables are categorical in nature <br>
* XGBOOST (One Hot Encoding)
* LightGBM (One Level Encoding)
* Factorization Machines (Embedding Vectors)
* Neural Networks
* Attentional Factorization Machine
* Neural Factorization Machine
**P.S:** These are only few of the possible approaches. There are numerous alternates available. I've specifically touched upon these as each of these model utilize different types of encoding for categorical variables.
